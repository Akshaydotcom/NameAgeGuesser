Project Title: Name Age Guesser

Project Description: 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This is a basic React Application that uses an API to guess the age of the name given to it.

It has 1 component called the Guesser that is used to connect the API and send the name to it. It returns to it's parent the data given by the API.
The Application then keeps track of all guesses and the ages corresponding to the names given by the API. 

This application uses bootstrap to make it mobile device optimized, and uses axios to fetch data from the given API. 

Some Features that can be implemented:
1. Storing the guesses even after browser refresh
2. Adding a dark mode/light mode toggle 

Running the Project:
Once downloaded, only the command npm start is necessary to run the project
